<p>
My research contributes to two main themes: <strong>attention economy</strong> and <strong>sustainable operations</strong>. 
</p>

<p>
The first theme, &#127911;<strong>attention economy</strong>&#9200;, addresses how consumers' attention under cognitive restriction is shaped by information technology. 
Attention becomes the major source of monetization and market values because digital transformation has removed the monetary marginal costs of transactions but not consumers' cognitive resources, 
which is particularly relevant to subscription-based markets, e.g., streaming platforms.
My studies in this stream examine how the unique characteristics of streaming platforms interplay with information technologies in shaping consumer behaviors through the lens of behavioral economics.
</p>

<p>
The second theme, &#9851;<strong>sustainable operations</strong>&#127793;, aims to tackle managerial challenges in <strong>online platforms</strong> and <strong>energy economics</strong> stemming from societal consideration. 
Firstly, my studies investigate how online platforms and their policies can alleviate social injustice, such as inequality, discrimination, and misinformation, occurring on online platforms.
Secondly, my research examines the roles of technology adoption and implementation in mitigating carbon footprints and mitigating the inequality related to technology. 
</p>

<p>
Methodologically, my research benefits from econometrics and experiments to identify causal relationships and complements these approaches with natural language processing and image processing techniques.
Furthermore, I often use stylized models building on economic theories to provide a parsimonious framework for empirical contexts.
