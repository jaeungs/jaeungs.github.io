I am an assistant professor at the School of Business, the University of Connecticut. I usually stay in the Stamford campus, so please feel free to call/text/email me when you travel around :statue_of_liberty:New York City!:wave:

My research and teaching aim to :one:**provide fresh perspectives on phenomena** and :two:**guide skilled individuals and organizations to ask the right questions**. My research stream on :headphones:**attention economy**:alarm_clock:, digital markets monetized by attention due to non-monetary marginal costs and limited cognitive capacities, has attained the first goal in a rigorous manner. I love to explore my daily life, media, and entertainment with formal languages of economics and statistics, which help me understand qualitative values through the lens of quantitative theories. For example, as a big fan of popular music artists, such as NewJeans, Nightwish, and Pentatonix, I have discovered and listened to their songs through streaming platforms and attended live performances. The music lover's journey can be understood as an economic agent's series of decisions shaped by numerous information technologies and their interactions with physical contexts, which my published papers directly inform about based on econometric analysis ([Sim et al. 2022a](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2021.1321), [Sim et al. 2022b](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2021.12.030)). 

My research stream on :recycle:**sustainable operations**:seedling:, exploring managerial practices to promote societal and environmental sustainability, has contributed to the second goal. While people often share the same ultimate goals for an equal, just, and sustainable society, they have substantially different paths to the ultimate goals in their minds because of uncertainties. My data-driven approach has provided valuable insights into these paths and often revealed unintended consequences of seemingly straightforward options without debates. For instance, one of my studies showed that the adoption and use of information technology could promote pro-environmental behavior, but the benefit saturates quickly with the usage level, calling for a reconsideration of implementation strategies after technology adoption ([Sim et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.17705/1jais.00786)). I actively bring my work and other relevant papers to my classrooms to help students reconsider the objectives of data analytics, programming, and business strategies to incorporate various stakeholders and the sustainability of business.
